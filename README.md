# Heap Exploitation

This short book is written for people who want to understand the internals of 'heap memory', particularly the implementation of glibc's 'malloc' and 'free' procedures, and also for security researchers who want to get started in the field of heap exploitation.

The first section of the book covers an in-depth, yet concise, description about heap internals. The second section covers some of the most famous attacks. It is assumed that the reader is unfamiliar with this topic. For experienced readers, this text might be good for a quick revision.

# malloc_state

This structure represents the header details of an Arena. The main thread's arena is a global variable and not part of the heap segment. Arena headers(`malloc_state` structures) for other threads are themselves stored on the heap segment. Non main arenas can have multiple heaps('heap' here refers to the internal structure used instead of the heap segment) associated with them.

```c
struct malloc_state
{
  /* Serialize access.  */
  __libc_lock_define (, mutex);
  /* Flags (formerly in max_fast).  */
  int flags;
  
  /* Fastbins */
  mfastbinptr fastbinsY[NFASTBINS];
  /* Base of the topmost chunk -- not otherwise kept in a bin */
  mchunkptr top;
  /* The remainder from the most recent split of a small request */
  mchunkptr last_remainder;
  /* Normal bins packed as described above */
  mchunkptr bins[NBINS * 2 - 2];
  
  /* Bitmap of bins */
  unsigned int binmap[BINMAPSIZE];
  
  /* Linked list */
  struct malloc_state *next;
  /* Linked list for free arenas.  Access to this field is serialized
     by free_list_lock in arena.c.  */
  struct malloc_state *next_free;
  /* Number of threads attached to this arena.  0 if the arena is on
     the free list.  Access to this field is serialized by
     free_list_lock in arena.c.  */
     
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T attached_threads;
  /* Memory allocated from the system in this arena.  */
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T system_mem;
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T max_system_mem;
};
